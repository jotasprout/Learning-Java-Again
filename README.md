# Learning-Java-Again
My second full-time attempt at learning Java

My first time was after finishing the Rev-Up program for Revature. 
I am about to start the Dev-10 academy which is an unpaid bootcamp on Jave and other assorted programming goodies. 
This time, I am taking every spare moment to read Head First Java, which I've had for a while, and a new book also at the top of all the "Best of" lists, Essential Java and hoping to stay ahead, I am taking the Java Masterclass on Udemy.
